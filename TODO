test and implement parallel computing
Progress bar
This idea is not yet clear: simply replacing the , seperator with | means nothing useful.
with the help of subsref, could implement a full path specifier tha support
regex and glob pattern as well as some special functions, to get a more unified
interface:
'data/sub[0-9]*\.mat|previous().dataCell{1:3}.file()(1:end, :)'
